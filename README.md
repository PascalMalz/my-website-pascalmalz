CV website to show some projects as well as job and education timeline

This website represents my digital CV. I developed everything from scratch. The website is running on my own server. I added some of my projects related to computer science and engeneering, but with a very high level description. In the "Summery - Time Line" you can track my career - it's refreshing automatically. Also I added a little game to prevent to get too bored :D. Feel free to contact me. You can find the dropdown for contact information in the top of this page.
